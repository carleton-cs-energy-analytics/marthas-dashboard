In addition to the Python packages we are using, Orange also makes a desktop client for interactive/visual data mining!

1. You can download the latest version here: https://orange.biolab.si/download/
2. Once downloaded, go into `options -> add-ons` and select `associate`

A first stab at using the program can be found on the martha's dashboard `association-rules` branch, located at [`marthas_dashboard/marthas_dashboard/analysis/or_association_rules.ows`](https://github.com/carleton-cs-energy-analytics/marthas-dashboard/blob/association-rules/marthas_dashboard/analysis/or_association_rules.ows).
