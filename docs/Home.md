Welcome to the energy-analytics-comps wiki!

## Project Structure

Our COMPS project is currently split into two separate repositories:

```
carleton-cs-energy-analytics
  |
  +-- energy-analytics-comps
  +-- marthas-dashboard
```

- The [`energy-analytics-comps`](https://github.com/carleton-cs-energy-analytics/energy-analytics-comps) repo acquires energy data, imports it into the database, and serves data via an API at: http://energycomps.its.carleton.edu/api/index.php.

- The [`marthas-dashboard`](https://github.com/carleton-cs-energy-analytics/marthas-dashboard) repo queries the API, and serves useful visualizations at: http://energycomps.its.carleton.edu/dashboard/. Analysis lives over here, too.


## Documentation

Documentation for both repos is located here, in the `energy-analytics-comps` [Github Wiki tab](https://github.com/carleton-cs-energy-analytics/energy-analytics-comps/wiki). _If you add a page to it, add a link here!_

## Task Management

- Tasks related to each repo are created/managed using that repo's Github issue tracker.
  * [energy-analytics-comps issues](https://github.com/carleton-cs-energy-analytics/energy-analytics-comps)
  * [marthas-dashboard issues](https://github.com/carleton-cs-energy-analytics/marthas-dashboard/issues)

- Tasks from both repos are organized into projects, on the [organization's project page](https://github.com/orgs/carleton-cs-energy-analytics/projects)
